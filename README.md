# Student-Attendance-Management-System
This is a C++ Project based on File-Handling which can be used to make attendance of Student based on their roll no. It takes Student information from Student such as First Name,
Last Name, Father's Name, Mobile Number, Stream etc. It store all these details in binary/text files, which keeps record for further processing. Program automatically generate 
roll no for each user and login id and password which can be used by each student to see their details or they can change it which is same as the Profile we see on different 
platforms and similarally it does the same thing for teachers so that they can make attendance of Students.
